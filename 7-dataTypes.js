// In javascript you may have various data types. When you declare a variable, you may assign a value of this. The value of a variable determine a data type of this variable. The five primitive types are:

// let string = "a" - This variable have a string type.
// let number = 1 - This variable have a number type.
// let boolean = "a" - This variable have a boolean type.
// let undefined =  - This variable have a undefined type.
// let null = null - This variable have a null value and a object type.

// Object and arrays are two other data types in javascript. Despite array, objects and variables with null value are different, they are all a object data type.
