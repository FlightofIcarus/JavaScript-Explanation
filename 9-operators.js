// In javascript, we have a many types of operators. Logical operators, comparison operators, conditional operators, type operators, arithmetic operators and assignment operators. Each this operators has your finality.

// The assignment operators serve for add a value to a variable.
// =, +=, -=, *=, /=, %= and **= In all of yours examples, the "=" symbol is a assignment's responsible, and others operators follow the same comportament which in arithmetic operations. "+=" represent a assignment value plus other value, and is used more in reassignment values.

// let a = 2; a += 2 - In this examplo, a receive 2, and after this receive your value plus 2 (new value), and passed to a = 4.

// The arithmetic's operators have a matematical operations and it is used with numbers.
// + addition; - subtraction; * multiplication; / division; % modulus(rest of division); ** exponentiation; ++ increment and -- decrement. In increment and decrement, your orders change the your comportament.

// a++ and ++a are differents increments. In first, the increment is processed after consulting the variable, in second, the arithmetic's operation is processed before.

// The comparison's operators serve to compare two values and answer true or false from that comparison.

// == value equal to; === value and type equal; != not equal(differents); !== value or type not equals; > greater than; >= greater or equal than; < less than; <= less or equal than.

// In conditional operators we have the ? ternary operator. It behaves the same as ifelse. The conditional sctruture ? answer if true : answer if false.

// Ours logicals operators in javascript are &&(and), ||(or) and !(not). Theys operators serve to verify logigals conditions.

// The types operators typeof and instanceof serves to return the type of a variable and if have an object in an instance of an object type.
