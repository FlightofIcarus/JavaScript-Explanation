// Concatenation is the process to combine variables and others logigal expressions with strings. Programs may have a many outputs result, and strings are a textual form. To combine a text with the value of a variable, use concatenation. Two ways are more used.

// With plus symbol and with template string (template literals), trougth using ` at the beging and at the end of text. 

// In template string, the logical espressions and variables are isolated by ${}, with your value into curly brackets.

// Ex.: `This is a template ${string}.`

// With the plus operator, the concatenation follow the down example.

// "This is a example with" + plus + " symbol."

// With concatanation, you are write a lot strings and logigals contents. When you use a plus operator beteween numbers and strings, you are concatening this. A 5 + "5" result in "55", not 10.
